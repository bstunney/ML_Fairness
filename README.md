Spotify Playlists and Musical Genre Classification

I will focus on implicit genre classification of musical artists
on Spotify. Genre classification based off of race is a potentially problematic phenomenon, that could be exacerbated by
automatic playlist generation and playlist recommendation
algorithms. For example, to include a black country singerâ€™s
songs in an automatically generated playlist called "R&B
beats."
I am interested in investigating these playlists at a large scale
to see if this is a systemic problem within Spotify, particularly for R&B (Rhythm and Blues) and black artists,.
